First make sure you have a Unix-type shell on your computer.

On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program called Terminal, which is already available
on your computer. If you're using Windows, you'll need to download a separate program to access the shell. [Follow this tutorial to install Git Bash on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8).

The workshop uses data from https://github.com/ceumicrodata/scientific-computing-bootcamp/tree/master/data. You will learn in a later lesson how to work with git and GitHub. For now, your instructor will help save the datafiles to your computer.
